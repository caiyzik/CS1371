%   - first assignment posted
%   - instructions to download 'free' copies of MATLAB are availible on T-Square
%
% CONCEPT:
%    Procedural Abstraction
% Abstraction is the process of taking examples and making them more
% general. For example, if you wanted to write a program that baked a
% virtual cake, you could put the whole recipe in one script. But it would
% make the code more readable to put each instruction in its own function.
% Abstraction is also the process of taking a problem and understand what
% variables you would need to manipulate in your code. In the baking
% problem, good variables would be each ingredient used. 
%
%   - storing your stuff
% It would be smart to store all of the MATLAB files pertaining to this
% class in a CS1371 folder within the MATLAB folder created in your
% Documents after you install MATLAB. Store each homework assignment into
% its own folder and create a separate folder for Lecture Notes. 

%THE getMostRecentFiles() FUNCTION MUST BE STORED IN THE MATLAB DIRECTORY
%OUTSIDE OF THE CS1371 FOLDER IN ORDER TO WORK PROPERLY
%   - Matlab files:
%       - scripts
%       - functions
%
% IMPLEMENTATION
%   - MATLAB functions
    %example of a function header
    function [outputs] = functionName(inputs)
    end
%   - specifically, how to do your HW
%Homework consists of two sections ABCs, which help you review concepts
%taught in class and Drill Problems.
%For each Drill Problem you will need to write a function header that
%matches the name of the problem! If the function header is written
%incorrectly your homework can not be graded!
