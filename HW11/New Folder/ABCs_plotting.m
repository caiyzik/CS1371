% ABCs of Plotting
%
%
% Directions:
%   Follow the steps specified below and fill in the blanks to complete
%   this plotting code.

% 1. Create a 2x2 subplot and begin plotting at the top left quarter


% 2. Plot the 2-dimensional curve specified by the x-points held in the 
% vector x1, and the y points held in the vector y1. The plot should be
% done using red circles.



% 3. Continue with the 2x2 subplot, but plot in the top right quarter.


% 4. Plot the 3-dimensional curve specified by the x-points held in the 
% vector x2, the y points held in the vector y2, and the z points held in
% the vector z2. The plot should be with black stars (in MATLAB, the 
% asterisk is used to plot a star).



% 5. Continue with the 2x2 subplot, but plot in the bottom left quarter.



% 6. Plot the following two 2-D curves. The first curve is specified by the
% x and y points in x3 and y3. It should be plotted with green plus signs.
% The second curve is specified by the x and y points in x4 and y4. It
% should be plotted with blue squares. You should only use one plot call to
% achieve this plot.



% 7. Continue with the 2x2 subplot, but plot in the bottom right quarter.


% 8. Set hold on so the following plots will show up on top of each
% other.


% 9. Plot a red half-circle (upper portion) with a radius of 3. 
% For the theta, use 100 evenly spaced values from 0 to pi (inclusive).


% 10. Plot the 2-D curve specified by the x and y points in x5 and y5. The
% plot should be with a blue dashed line.


% 11. Make the axis square.


% 12. Set hold to off, so that no more plots will plot over the current
% plot.


% 13. Title the graph as 'ABCs Plotting'. Exactly.


% 14. Label the x-axis as 'x-axis'. Exactly.


% 15. Label the y-axis as 'y-axis'. Exactly.
