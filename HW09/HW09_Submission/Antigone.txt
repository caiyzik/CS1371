Antigone 

Ismene, my own sister by blood, 
Do you see how Zeus fulfills in us 
While we live the woes of Oedipus? 
There is no pain, no affliction, no shame 
Nor dishonour that is not present 
Among your suffering and mine. 



And what of this new proclamation

DW Myatt - Sophocles, Antogone 



Sophocles: Antigone 



By the General to all the people? 
Have you heard - and know what it means? 
Or do you not understand how the suffering 
Of our foe now comes to our clan? 

Ismene 

I have heard of nothing told of our folk, Antigone, 
Whether grievous or good since we two 
Lost our two brothers killed in one day 

leir own two hands. 
And since the Argive army fled this same night 
have heard nothing to give me more sorrow or joy.

It is that Creon has given burial honour 

only one of our brothers, leaving the other dishonoured

the dead below. But pitiful is the death of Polynices 
For by royal decree no one may cover him, 

lent his death or weep 
But must leave him unburied as a welcome feast 

carrion birds to eat as they will. 
Such, they say, is the proclamation of Creon "the noble" 

>r you and me. For me! And soon shall he be here 
To proclaim this directly to those who have not heard. 

does not hold this as of no worth 
Since whosoever disobeys the edict 

by a public stoning in the citadel - be murdered! 

Thus things are - and now you shall swiftly show 
you are noble or will debase the race that gave you birth!
